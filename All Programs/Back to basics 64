#Working with label widgets, frame widgets

from tkinter import *
mygui=Tk()

mygui.title("About Me")
mygui.geometry("400x200")

firstframe=Frame(mygui) #this statement simply means a frame will be placed inside the root window
firstframe.grid()
lbl=Label(firstframe,text="Enter Expression To Solve")
lbl.grid() # this ensures that the widget is visible. (Also, Note that all widgestd need to have the grid() method)










mygui.mainloop()#this part of the program create an event loop. it stay open waiting to handle events
